# TV Tools for Quartz Composer
TV Tools is a free collection of Quartz Composer patches that helps build prototypes for interactive TV apps.

## Install
TV Tools work with Quartz Composer, a motion graphics tool for Mac. Some patches also require Origami framework. Links to get QC and Origami are available on [http://facebook.github.io/origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami).

Once you have installed QC and Origami, just copy ``TV Tools`` folder to ``~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches``. You're done. Happy prototyping!

## Not only TV
TV means that most patches was created for reproducing TV patterns (focus, grids and so on). But there’s no limitation on apps or platform in Quartz Composer, so you can use this patches for mobile or whatever you want prototypes. For example Focus patch may be used for switching states or screens, or move objects etc. Grid Tool patch can make image grids which is not only a TV pattern.
