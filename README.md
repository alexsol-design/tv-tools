# TV Tools for Quartz Composer
TV Tools is a free collection of Quartz Composer patches that helps build prototypes for interactive TV apps.

## Getting TV Tools
TV Tools work with Quartz Composer, a motion graphics tool for Mac. Some patches also require Origami framework. Links to get QC and Origami are available on [http://origami.facebook.com/](http://origami.facebook.com/).

Once you have installed QC and Origami, just copy ``TV Tools`` folder to ``~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches``. You're done. Happy prototyping!

## Use widely
Although TV prefix means that most patches has been created to reproduce TV patterns (focus, grids and so on) there’s no limitation on apps or platform in QC, so you can use these patches for mobile or other prototypes. For example the Focus patch may be used to switch between states or screens. The Grid Tool patch can make image grids which are not only a TV pattern. Hope you’ll find it useful.
