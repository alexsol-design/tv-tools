# TV Tools
TV Tools is a free collection of Quartz Composer patches that helps build prototypes for interactive TV apps.

## Install
TV Tools work with Quartz Composer, a motion graphics tool for Mac. Some patches also require Origami framework. Links to get QC and Origami are available on [http://facebook.github.io/origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami).

Once you have installed QC and Origami, just copy ``TV Tools`` folder to ``~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches``. You're done. Happy prototyping!
